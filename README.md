# Hatted Shadows (2022)
A mod for Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven (2002).

- This mod produces fedora-wearing shadows for every used player, NPC and cutscene model wearing one
- Human models not wearing fedoras should not have these shadows
- Shadows for coats, other hat types and sex variants can probably be added later, but for now this is all
- If you see any bugs, please let me know
- Back-up your files, please!
